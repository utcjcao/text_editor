# texteditor
 
basic text editor with syntax highlighting written in C. followed kilo's tutorial online

what i learned:
memory management, a lot of memcpy and memset, compiler flags, enums, bit operations, and escape characters

what i struggled with:
all of the above, + using gdb to try and debug, especially if it was a minor issue that wasn't a syntax mistake. since it was all in one file, it was hard to separate main concerns, so learned some key commands too
